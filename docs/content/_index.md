# Main Concepts

The ontology captures the following concepts in the __cheese__ domain

- _Cheese_ types
- _Raw Materials_ and _Milk_ used to make a cheese
- _Environment_ where a cheese has taken place
- _Aging_ or _Ripening_ of a cheese
- _Certifications_
- _Locations_ were a cheese is made

# SWRL Rules

---

## Rule 1

With this rule you can __infer__ that a cheese which is made with a certified milk must be a certified cheese

<img src="swrl1.svg" alt="SWRL1" width="80%">

```prolog
obo:FOODON_00001013(?cheese) ^ isMadeWithMilk(?cheese, ?milk) ^
           ProtectedMilkRawMaterial(?milk) -> food-cheese:Formaggio(?cheese)
```

<small>
‚ö†Ô∏è This rule implies that if a cheese is made from certified milk, then the cheese itself is also certified
</small>

Due to the _open world assumption_, we are unable to tight this constraint even with __SWLR__.

---

## Rule #2

This rule defines that the __ripening__ of a cheese should be between 1 and 30 days.

<img src="swrl2.svg" alt="SWRL2" width="55%">

```prolog
hasRipeningDuration(?r, ?d) ^ Ripening(?r) ->
swrlb:greaterThanOrEqual(?d, 1) ^
swrlb:lessThanOrEqual(?d, 30)
```

<small>
In the ontology when referring to the ripening period we refer to a period expressed in days
</small>

---

## Rule #3

This rule defines that the __aging__ period should be at least one month:

<img src="swrl3.svg" alt="SWRL3" width="55%">

```prolog
Aging(?a) ^ hasAgingDuration(?a, ?d) -> swrlb:greaterThanOrEqual(?d, 1)
```

<small>
In the ontology when referring to the aging period we refer to a period expressed in month
</small>

# SPARQL queries

---

## Query #1

_"Find all cheeses with ripeness between 5 and 20 days"_

```sql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX : <https://github.com/nicolasfara/cheese-ontology/>

SELECT ?cheese ?label ?duration
WHERE {
    ?cheese :hasRipening/:hasRipeningDuration ?duration.

    OPTIONAL { ?cheese rdfs:label ?label }
    FILTER (?duration > 5 && ?duration < 20)
}
ORDER BY ?label
```

---

## Query #2

_"Find all cheeses with a certification"_

```sql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
